## Additional Common Configuration
Should your project need to work with an external API, you will want to add the following:
* In your `Gemfile`:
  * Available to all environments:
    * `gem 'faraday'` - for making http requests ([docs](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday))
  * Under `group :test`
    * `gem 'vcr'` - for stubbing ([docs](https://github.com/vcr/vcr))
    * `gem 'webmock'` - for mocking (used by VCR)([docs](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock))


* To make these gems available:
```
bundle
```
* Add configuration in `spec/rails_helper.rb`:
```
require 'vcr'
VCR.configure do |config|
  config.cassette_library_dir = "spec/vcr_cassettes"
  config.hook_into :webmock
end
```
* In `.gitignore`, ignore the cassettes that will be made:
```
# Ignore vcr cassettes
/spec/vcr_cassettes
```
