NOTE: This was a timed assessment from the Turing School. Due to the large amount of progress required in a short amount of time there is significant room for improvement and refactoring.

* The JavaScript is poorly organized and the ES5 syntax would be improved with the use of ES6 classes.
* The Rails controllers also have logic that can likely be extracted to the models.
* The barebones styling utilized bootstrap and is not very user-friendly.
